# Spike Train Analysis Project

This project contains tools for analyzing neural spike train data and measuring complexity.

## Project Structure
- `raw_data/`: Contains the raw spike train data
- `src/`: Source code
  - `data/`: Data loading and preprocessing
  - `models/`: Neural network models
  - `analysis/`: Complexity analysis tools
  - `utils/`: Utility functions
- `scripts/`: Analysis scripts

## Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Place raw data in `raw_data/` directory

## Usage
- Run classification: `python scripts/train_classifier.py`
- Run complexity analysis: `python scripts/analyze_complexity.py`

## Paper
Arxiv
