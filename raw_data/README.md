# Raw Data Directory

This directory contains the raw data files used for proteinoid spike analysis and neural network training.

## Files Description

### meta_data.csv
- Primary data file containing voltage-sensitive dye recordings from proteinoid samples
- Contains 5 datasets (Data1 through Data5) of spike trains
- Sampling rate: 600 data points per second
- Format: CSV with time series data and binary spike indicators (0 or 1)
- Used for both training (Data1-4) and testing (Data5) the classification model

### dataset5_predictions.csv
- Contains predictions generated by the neural network model for Dataset 5
- Columns:
  - Time: Timestamp of the recording
  - Spike: Actual spike value (0 or 1)
  - Predicted_Spike: Model's prediction (0 or 1)
- Used for model evaluation and performance analysis

## Data Format Specifications

## Usage Notes

1. The data files should not be modified directly to maintain data integrity
2. Use the data loading functions provided in `src/data/data_loader.py` to process these files
3. Large data files (>100MB) should be added to .gitignore
4. Keep a backup of the original data files

## Data Collection Parameters

- Recording Device: ADC-24, Pico Technology, UK
- Sampling Rate: 600 Hz
- Recording Method: Voltage-sensitive (aminonaphthylethenylpyridinium) dyes
- Temperature: Room temperature (assumed 25Â°C)
- Duration: Variable per dataset

## .gitignore Configuration
The `.gitignore` file in this directory is configured to exclude:
- Large data files (>100MB)
- Temporary files
- System-specific files
- Intermediate processing results

## Data Integrity
SHA-256 checksums for data verification:
```
# Run the following commands to verify data integrity
sha256sum meta_data.csv
sha256sum dataset5_predictions.csv
```
